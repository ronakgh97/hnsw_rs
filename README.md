An implementation of HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search.
The implementation is not directly based on the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.09320), but is inspired
by it. This implementation is simple and easy to understand, while still being *reasonably* efficient and scalable in
future

HNSW implementation.
